            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Arturo. I'm currently a Educator for Los Angeles Unified School District. I graduated
                from the University of California, Riverside in June 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to transition my career into software engineering. Teaching is one of the most rewarding things I have been
                able to do. There is nothing like putting smiles on the faces of young kids eager to learn. I want to be able to create 
                this level of impact through products that change the world. I'm grateful for all of the tough times I have been through 
                and for all the oppurtunities and resources that have been provided for me. I will work hard to help those that stem from
                similar roots as my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software has always been my area of interest, more specfically front-end development. My primary language is C++, with 
                exposure to JavaScript, C, and C#. I've worked on website development and utilized tools such as ReactJS, Node JS, 
                RESTful APIs, and .NET Core. I would love to continue to grow my knowledge of back-end language and technologies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few hobbies and interests that can take me away from my side projects. I enjoy doing the things I was not able 
                to do as a kid. I recently started collecting sport cards. I've already pulled a few gems like a gold /10 Jiri P. rookie
                and a tie dye Khabib Nuragomedov!!! I also love watching UFC events with my friends while continously putting money on parlays
                I swear will eventually hit. But my favorite thing to do is EAT(kbbq, sushi, tacos, etc.)  
            </p>
            <p>If you want to talk about Game of Thrones, Khamzat Chimaev, or anything else, let's chat :)</p>
